<HiddenH1>Daniel Berndt - Berlin-based Web Developer</HiddenH1>
<section>
<HelloH2>Hello!</HelloH2>

I'm Daniel. Berlin-based **web developer** with a background in
**computer linguistics** and **machine learning**.

These days I'm helping game devs (and others) to add some delight to their project management routines. Check out what I'm doing together with [Maschinen-Mensch](http://maschinen-mensch.com/) and [Codecks](https://www.codecks.io) here!

## Technologies

Both, [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Flow](https://flow.org/) are great additions for creating maintainable software.

Database-wise I'm a big fan of [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), even though I'm still not quite sure, how to actually pronounce it.

Oh yes. And I do quite a lot of contract work with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). Not necessarily because I like the technology, but because it often makes a lot of sense for the customer.

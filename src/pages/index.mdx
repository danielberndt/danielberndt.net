<HiddenH1>Daniel Berndt - Berlin-based Web Developer</HiddenH1>
<section>
<HelloH2>Hello!</HelloH2>

I'm Daniel. Berlin-based **web developer** with a background in
**computer linguistics** and **machine learning**.

These days I'm helping game devs (and others) to add some delight to their project management routines. Check out what I'm doing with [Codecks](https://www.codecks.io) here!

## Technologies

While most of my focus lies on frontend work within the [React](https://reactjs.org/) ecosystem, I'm comfortable working with the full stack. This includes [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) in the backend, [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for infrastructure matters.

You can frequently find me doing side project to explore alternatives though.
